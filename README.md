# Native Player

Native Player is a reference application for NaCl Player API. It shows how to
use NaCl Player API in multiple modes (e.g. a playback from either a URL address
or using demuxed elementary stream data, with and without DRM). Native Player features a modular design that allows easy modification and reusability.
